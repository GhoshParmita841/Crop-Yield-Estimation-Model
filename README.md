# Crop Yield Estimation Model
Synergy of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for early-stage crop yield estimation: A case study over a state of Germany. 

This research project is the outcome of the activities primarily led by Parmita Ghosh during her bi-nationally supervised master thesis work under the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) IIT Master Sandwich Programme 2018. The authors are grateful to Hessisches Statistisches Landesamt for providing the opportunity to use the IACS filed polygons, BEE crop yield dataset and conduct the work there. The authors would like to thank the European Space Agency (ESA) for providing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data sets Copernicus Open Access Hub.

This project is a collaborative research work of the following institutes:

Microwave Remote Sensing Lab, Centre of Studies in Resources Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India.

Institut für Geodäsie, Technische Universität Darmstadt, 64287 Darmstadt, Germany.
